I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping<br>
While my guitar gently weeps<br>
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping<br>
Still, my guitar gently weeps<br>

我遙望眾人，看見那沉睡著的愛<br>
當我的吉他輕輕啜泣<br>
我看著地板，發現它需要被打掃<br>
我的吉他仍輕輕啜泣<br>

I don't know why nobody told you<br>
How to unfold your love<br>
I don't know how someone controlled you<br>
They bought and sold you<br>

我不明白為何沒人告訴過妳<br>
如何展現妳的愛<br>
我不明白某人如何控制了你<br>
他們拐騙並出賣了妳<br>

I look at the world and I notice it's turning<br>
While my guitar gently weeps<br>
With every mistake, we must surely be learning<br>
Still, my guitar gently weeps, yeah<br>

我望著世界，發現它正轉動著<br>
當我的吉他輕輕啜泣<br>
犯下的每個錯誤，我們必須從中學到教訓<br>
我的吉他仍輕輕啜泣，yeah<br>

I don't know how you were diverted<br>
You were perverted, too<br>
I don't know how you were inverted<br>
No one alerted you<br>

我不知道你如何被糟蹋的<br>
你也變糟了<br>
我不知道你如何被影響<br>
沒有人警告過你<br>

I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping<br>
While my guitar gently weeps<br>
(I look) look at you all<br>
Still, my guitar gently weeps<br>

我遙望眾人，看見那沉睡著的愛<br>
當我的吉他輕輕啜泣<br>
遙望眾人<br>
我的吉他仍輕輕啜泣<br>

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, ooh
